## üìä Business Problem
The bank faced rising default rates and inconsistent portfolio performance across different borrower profiles, time periods, and geographies. They need to optimize their loan offerings and improve customer segmentation to maximize profitability while minimizing risk. They have observed varying loan application behaviors across different borrower profiles based on factors such as homeownership status, employment tenure, loan purpose, loan term, and geographical region. The goal is to refine our loan products, tailor them to the specific needs of different segments, and ensure that we mitigate risks effectively.

This loan analysis project provides a comprehensive review of loan application trends, funding distribution, borrower profiles, and repayment performance. 
The goal is to refine their loan products, tailor them to specific customer needs, and mitigate risks effectively. The Power BI dashboard is prepared to analyze loan portfolio data and provide insights on which loan terms and purposes resonate most with different segments, how to personalize offerings based on homeownership and employment tenure, and identify high-potential regions for targeted marketing.

1. Good Loans Dominate the Portfolio
   - 86.2% of all loans are categorized as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, meaning they were either fully paid or currently in good standing
   - These 33.2K loans had a funded amount of $370.2M, and impressively, the bank recovered the full $435.8M (including interest)
   - Most of our borrowers are reliable‚Äîthis builds a strong foundation for future expansion

2. Bad Loans Aare low in number but significant
   - 13.8% of loans (5.3K) were charged off, meaning the bank was unable to recover the full amount
   - While $65.5M was funded, only $37.3M was recovered‚Äîan approximate 43% loss
   - One in seven loans are turning bad, need to tighten screening process and risk models

3. Loan Status Breakdown Reveals Key Trends
   
    | Status          | Funded Amount | Received Amount | Avg. Interest | Avg. DTI |
    | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------- |

## Key Insights
  <p align="center">
    <img src="Details.PNG" width="1000px">
  </p>
  
   - Loan Growth is Strong: With 38.6K applications and a 13% MoM increase in funding, the bank is seeing steady growth in both demand and disbursement
   - High Loan Performance: 86.2% of loans are performing well, indicating effective credit policies and borrower reliability

   - Long-Term & Mortgage-Backed Borrowers Preferred: Most funding goes to 60-month loans and mortgage holders, showing a focus on lower-risk, asset-backed lending

## Business Recommendation

   - Expand offerings for borrowers with lower DTI and stable income‚Äîthey consistently repay well
   - Use incentives like lower interest rates or loyalty bonuses to attract more of this group
   - Set stricter thresholds on DTI (e.g., <13.5%) and cap interest rates for first-time or unknown borrowers
   - Analyze why these 5.3K loans failed‚Äîare they tied to certain regions, purposes, or professions
   - Build early-warning systems based on interest, DTI, and behavior patterns to intervene before charge-off
   - With consistent MoM growth, leverage marketing campaigns and special offers in high-performing months
   - Since many are consolidating debt, offer debt management tools, personal finance coaching, or budgeting apps as value-added services.Build trust and increase repayment rates long-term

## üìå Conclusion

The loan analysis reveals a strong and growing loan portfolio, with 38.6K applications and a 13% month-over-month increase in funding, indicating rising borrower demand and effective disbursement strategies. A significant 86.2% of loans are performing well, showing that the bank has a stable and reliable customer base. However, the 13.8% of charged-off loans, often linked to higher interest rates and DTI ratios, highlight areas of potential risk that need attention.

The analysis also shows that debt consolidation is the leading loan purpose, suggesting that many borrowers are focused on managing existing financial burdens rather than taking loans for investment or asset-building. Borrowers with long employment history and mortgage backing received the highest funding, indicating the bank‚Äôs preference for low-risk, stable profiles. Lastly, the preference for longer-term loans (60 months) points to borrowers‚Äô desire for manageable monthly repayments, but this may also increase the long-term credit risk if not closely monitored.

In summary, while the bank is in a strong position with high recovery and repayment rates, strategic focus on risk mitigation, borrower education, and product diversification will be essential for sustainable growth.
